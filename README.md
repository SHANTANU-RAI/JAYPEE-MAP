# JAYPEE-MAP

Data Structure Project implementing Dijkstra's algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph using various data structures having different complexities.

# Jaypee Maps Navigation System

The Jaypee Maps Navigation System is designed to enhance accessibility and convenience on the college campus by providing users with an efficient way to navigate between different locations. The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive navigation system known as "Jaypee Maps," allowing users to find the quickest route between any two points on the campus.

## Features Expected

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A user-friendly interface will enable users to input their desired locations and obtain the shortest path between them.
- **Graph Representation:** The campus layout will be modeled using adjacency matrices and lists to accurately capture connections and distances between various locations.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm will enable the system to determine the shortest path between locations efficiently.

- **Optimized Data Structures:** Various data structures such as adjacency lists, matrices, queues, priority queues (implemented via Binary Heap and Fibonacci Heap), AVL Trees (for creating sets), and Linked Lists (for implementing queues) will be utilized to enhance efficiency and optimize pathfinding algorithms.

- **Efficient Search and Pathfinding:** The system will ensure efficient pathfinding and navigation throughout the college campus, enhancing accessibility and convenience for users.

## Usage

To use the Jaypee Maps Navigation System, follow these steps:

1. Open the user-friendly interface.
2. Input your desired locations.
3. Obtain the shortest path between the specified locations.
4. Enjoy efficient navigation throughout the college campus.
